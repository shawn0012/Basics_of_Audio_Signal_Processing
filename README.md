# Basics_of_Audio_Signal_Processing

*(For this task the answer must be submitted as a GitHub repository containing a google colab notebook and all the files required to run the colab notebook)*

01. - [x] Create a Colab Notebook. 
02. - [x] Load an mp3 file into the colab notebook.
03. - [x] Plot the waveform of the audio in the notebook.
04. - [x] Plot a stft spectrogram of the audio file.
05. - [ ] Plot a melspectrogram of the audio file.
06. - [ ] Compute the duration in seconds of the audio file.
07. - [ ] Playback the audio file so we can listen to it in the notebook.
08. - [ ] Create a low pass filter with a cut frequency of 2kHz and attenuation of 60 dB in the stop band and a maximum passband ripple of 1dB. (you can use any kind of filter, design technique or algorithm you want).
09. - [ ] Plot the filter frequency response. (magnitude and phase).
10. - [ ] Plot the filter impulse response.
11. - [ ] Filter the audio file using the designed filter.
12. - [ ] Playback the filtered signal so we can listen to it in the notebook.
13. - [ ] Plot the stft spectrogram of the filtered signal.
14. - [ ] Save the filter parameters in a file so they can be shared.
15. - [ ] Save the filtered audio signal as a numpy array in a file.
16. - [ ] Upload the notebook, the numpy array filtered audio file and the file with the filter parameters in the github repository of the project.
