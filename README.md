##Basics of Audio Signal Processing 
(For this task the answer must be submitted as a GitHub repository containing a google colab notebook and all the files required to run the colab notebook)
[]Create a Colab Notebook.
[]Load an mp3 file into the colab notebook.
[]Plot the waveform of the audio in the notebook.
[]Plot a stft spectrogram of the audio file.
[]Plot a melspectrogram of the audio file.
[]Compute the duration in seconds of the audio file.
[]Playback the audio file so we can listen to it in the notebook.
[]Create a low pass filter with a cut frequency of 2kHz and attenuation of 60 dB in the stop band and a maximum passband ripple of 1dB. (you can use any kind of filter, design technique or algorithm you want).
[]Plot the filter frequency response. (magnitude and phase).
[]Plot the filter impulse response.
[]Filter the audio file using the designed filter.
[]Playback the filtered signal so we can listen to it in the notebook.
[]Plot the stft spectrogram of the filtered signal.
[]Save the filter parameters in a file so they can be shared.
[]Save the filtered audio signal as a numpy array in a file.
[]Upload the notebook, the numpy array filtered audio file and the file with the filter parameters in the github repository of the project.
